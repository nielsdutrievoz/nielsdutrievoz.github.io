My research focuses on the **atmospheric water cycle in Antarctica**, with a particular emphasis on **water isotopes**. To investigate this, I use the [**LMDZ6iso global atmospheric model**](https://lmdz.lmd.jussieu.fr/) to simulate isotope dynamics.  

In Antarctica, the study of water isotopes in surface snow, precipitation, and vapour is conducted with a dual objectives: **gaining a deeper understanding of isotopic signals archived in ice cores**, and **deciphering the contributions of different atmospheric processes in driving the water cycle, including boundary layer processes.** 

**Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) with water isotopes** provide a crucial tool for simulating fractionation and transport processes. They allow us to investigate **isotopic signatures across different timescales**, from meteorological events to seasonal and interannual variations, as well as past climate reconstructions within a physically coherent framework.

### Study 1: Antarctic Water Stable Isotopes in the Global Atmospheric Model LMDZ6: From Climatology to Boundary Layer Processes  

During my PhD, my first study focuses on **evaluating the LMDZ6iso global atmospheric model** by comparaison with **surface snow isotopes across Antarctica**, as well as **daily precipitation and continuous water vapor isotopes** at two East Antarctic stations: **Dumont d'Urville** (coastal) and **Concordia** (inland). This evaluation examines **spatial, seasonal, and diurnal isotopic variations** in the model.  

Next, I analyzed the **contributions of individual processes to boundary layer water vapor isotopes**, aiming to identify the key drivers of **clear-sky isotopic daily cycles** and to explain discrepancies between model simulations and observations.  

🔹 **At Concordia**, daily isotope variations are mainly driven by **surface sublimation**.  
🔹 **At Dumont d’Urville**, they are influenced by **both surface sublimation and advection by the katabatic flow**.  

These results suggest that **further improvements in LMDZ6iso** should prioritize **better representation of isotopic exchanges during sublimation and condensation under low temperatures**.

### Study 2: Water vapour isotope anomalies during an atmospheric river event at Dome C, East Antarctica (in preparation)

My second study focuses on **analyzing the isotopic anomaly in water vapour** induced by the passage of an **atmospheric river over Concordia** in December 2018. The isotopic composition of water vapour observed during this event can be explained by two key processes:  
- The isotopic signature of long-range water transport 
- Local moisture uptake during the event  

Using the LMDZ6iso simulation previously evaluated, we show that **surface sublimation is the primary driver** of the positive isotopic anomaly in vapour, contributing **60% of the total signal**. This sublimation effect is significantly increase during the event compared to typical diurnal cycles. The **remaining 40%** of the anomaly is attributed to **large-scale moisture advection associated with the atmospheric river**.    
These results highlight that the isotopic signal recorded in water vapor during atmospheric river events reflects a **combination of long-range moisture advection and interactions between the boundary layer and the snowpack**, reinforcing the importance of local surface processes in shaping Antarctic isotope variability.
